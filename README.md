Wordpress template

It's my first public project.

I created a basic template in wordpress to help developers in their first steps. 

Wordpress use the next structure:

- 404.php

- header.php
- front-page.php
- footer.php

- functions.php

- single.php

This template is using a front-page.php as the home web page. (configure this in wordpress Reading configurations)
