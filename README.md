# Kioru Template
Wordpress template

I created a basic template in Wordpress to help developers in their first steps. 

After the instalation of WordPress in your server add this folder to the directory:

/wp-content/themes/

Choise this template and done, enjoy. 

## Wordpress structure:

* header.php
* front-page.php
* footer.php
* home.php - it rendes the blog

* functions.php

* 404.php
* single.php

This template is using a front-page.php as the home web page. (configure this in wordpress Reading configurations)


## header.php

It has a logo and a menu

## front-page.php

It has 1 header, 5 sections, main (flow), and 5 sections. You can add special code to each section in Wordpress, remember this template use bootstrap, you can use the grid layout. 

## footer

It has 1 block with 3 columns, links and menu

## home.php

It has 1 header and 2 sections called top1, top2. You can add special code to each section in Wordpress.

## functions.php 

It helps to import the CSS, FONTS, and JavaScripts. Also it helps you to add the variables that you want into the template. 

The function my_widgets_init() helps you to add the sections in the widgets sections in Wordpress
