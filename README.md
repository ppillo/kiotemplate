# Kioru Template
Wordpress template

I created a basic template in Wordpress to help developers in their first steps. 

## Wordpress structure:

* header.php
* front-page.php
* footer.php

* functions.php

* 404.php
* single.php

This template is using a front-page.php as the home web page. (configure this in wordpress Reading configurations)


## header.php

It has a logo and a menu

## front-page.php

It has 1 header, 5 sections, main (flow), and 5 sections. You can add special code to each section in Wordpress, remember this template use bootstrap, you can use the grid layout. 

## footer

It has 1 block with 3 columns, links and menu
